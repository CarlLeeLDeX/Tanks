        Circle arena basically

Art Details (Up to the artists realy)
    Simply 3D Polygonal Geometry. Examples include crude boxes, dodecahedron's as crude spheres, etc etc etc...
    Skybox (Real sky or not, something that fits the asthetic)
        Could be also "indoors"
    Animations are generally not needed, as most objects can simply rotate.
        Example: A tank could always just face the direction of movement.
    
Gameplay Details
    Each turn is to be taken one at a time
    Each player has a "power" bar
    At the start of their turn, players "refuel" a portion of their power bar
    Players are allowed to:
        In normal mode:
            Move (Consumes power)
            Switch to "shoot" mode
        In shoot mode:
            Aim
            Shoot (Consumes power)
            Switch to "normal" mode
        End Turn (Via a button, or when out of power)
    
    Steps required for shooting
        Aim (Move the 8-way joystick or WASD) Tank does not move, and aiming is relative to the position of the tank itself
        Shoot:
            This could be done with a power gauge that one can hold to increase firepower (Like drawing an arrow)
                Could be hold and release, or tap once to start bar and tap a 2nd time to stop bar.
            The projectile will travel towards where the player is aiming, at the given power gauge
